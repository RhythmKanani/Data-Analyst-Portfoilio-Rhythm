### Data Profiling and Cleaning:
- Created Transform Bucket list Business-trf-rhy and subfolders in the S3 so that clean dataset can be stored for system and users. 
- Created a project in AWS Glue DataBrew.
- Faced issue while creating the project for data profiling and connecting to new dataset because of csv delimiter. I solved this issue by changing the delimiter type to semi colon  from commas.
- Created profiling and cleaning project on Glue Databrew and run the project so that data issues can be configured through creating job and running Job profile to normalize the dataset. (bus-rental-list-prj-rhy).
- Removed unnecassary fields (geom, postal code, street, etc.)
- Replaced null values with NA, median, or most frequent value respective of the data issues present.
- Applied regex on Business Name to clean special characters
- Filled the missing values with median in feespaid, missing values with most frequent value in issue date, expired date, Country, province. Standardized date formats to YYYY-MM-DD.
- Transformed and created a clean dataset in csv & parquet format for user and system perspective and stored it in new S3 bucket called as Business-trf-rhy.
